# scopes

- global scopes
- global object is the window object when we declare a varriable with var its availabe to window object but if we do that with let or const its not availabe on window object 

# Function scope 
- if we create a variable with function scope its only accessable to function scope 

# Block scope 
- let and const varriable inside of block scope we can't access it outside of the block but if we declare with var keyword we can access that varriable outside of the block scope 

# var is always function scoped and let and const is always block scoped 
## Scope chain
# Variable shadowing
