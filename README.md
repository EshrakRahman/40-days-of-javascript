# 40 Days of JavaScript ğŸš€

Welcome to my **40 Days of JavaScript** journey! This repository serves as a personal log and progress tracker as I dive deep into JavaScript through daily structured practice.

Inspired by the [40 Days of JavaScript Tracker by Tapas Adhikary (tapaScript)](https://www.youtube.com/tapasadhikary), this project is aimed at building a strong foundation in JavaScript and mastering the language in a consistent and progressive way.

## ğŸ“… How This Repo is Organized

- `day-01/` to `day-40/` â€” Daily practice folders with:
  - `notes.md` â€“ my personal notes
  - `practice.js` â€“ code samples and exercises
  - `resources.md` â€“ helpful links, videos, or references
- `projects/` â€“ small JavaScript projects created during or after the challenge
- `tracker/` â€“ export or screenshots of my Notion progress tracker (optional)

## âœ… Goals

- Learn core JavaScript concepts thoroughly
- Improve problem-solving through daily coding
- Build discipline and consistency
- Document everything for future reference and public sharing
